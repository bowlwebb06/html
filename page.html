    <p>Is a process used in cost accounting to plan and control an organization's financial resources. It involves setting financial targets, or budgets, for various departments or cost centers, and then comparing actual results to those targets to identify variances. This allows management to identify areas where costs are higher than expected and take corrective action to control expenses and improve profitability. Budgetary control is also used to ensure that resources are being used efficiently and effectively to achieve the organization's goals and objectives.</p>
